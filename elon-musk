    <h1>My Public letter to meet Elon Musk in person.</h1>
    <h2>I want to understand what future holds for me. So I look up to others</h2>
    <p>In this case it's Elon Musk who has to contact me first, because that's what men do. They meet others and expand the visible horizon of out future. I am keeping this message space high, because on some level I can understand what Elon Musk is doing. I can even understand why, if I know what he's doing. I can also understand you. I know you came here because you were interested. Doesn't matter you're a man or a woman, because now, I can talk to both.</p>
    <o>I can choose what to do, therefore I write make this page available under my own name. I will be the craftsman of my own future events. And yours in someway too.</p>
    <h2>How fast can a clean idea catch-on? I haven't sent any e-mails or messages about this to anyone yet.</h2>
    <p>What would you write to your personal authority?</p>
    <p>Written on 2016-03-12 at favorite time of my day using VIM via Mac OS X terminal.
    <p>Will update as the story unravels.</p>
    <h1>If this idea will stay, it will have to stick forever. ;)</h1>
    <h2>This page links nowehere, it doesn't have to, cus I'm tracking it.</h2>
